# Game Smart Contracts

## Setup

- `contracts` directory contains game smart contracts using the [Diamond](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) standard.
- `tasks` directory contains game constants, map generation, and deployment-related code.
- `test` directory contains tests for contracts using [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

Make sure that Yarn, Node, and Hardhat are installed globally. Run `yarn install` first to install dependencies.

## How to Use

To run Foundry tests use `yarn forge-test`.

To deploy the contracts locally, first spin up a local network using `npx hardhat node`. Then, deploy using `npx hardhat deploy --network ${NETWORK_NAME}`.

To deploy the testing map, use `npx hardhat deploy --network localhost --fixmap`.
